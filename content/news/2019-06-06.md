<h3>OpenHW Group created and announces CORE-V family of open-source cores for use in high volume production SoCs</h3>

<p><em>Rick O&rsquo;Connor, former Executive Director of the RISC-V Foundation, leads<br />
organization for collaboration, ecosystem development and open-source processor cores</em></p>

<p><em>Ottawa, Canada and Zurich, Switzerland, June 6, 2019: </em>A new not-for-profit global organization aims to boost the adoption of open-source processors by providing a platform for collaboration, creating a focal point for ecosystem development, and offering open-source IP for processor cores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Headed by Founder and CEO, Rick O&rsquo;Connor, the OpenHW Group has already recruited 13 sponsor organizations and expects this to grow to 25 by the end of 2019. OpenHW Group is a member of the <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V Foundation</a> of which O&rsquo;Connor was Executive Director until May this year, and has entered into a strategic partnership with the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/">Eclipse Foundation</a>, a global community for open-source software collaboration and innovation.</p>

<p>Inaugural OpenHW sponsors include Alibaba, Bluespec, CMC Microsystems, Embecosm, ETH Zurich (University), GreenWaves, Imperas, Metrics, Mythic AI, NXP, Onespin, Silicon Labs and Thales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OpenHW Group will serve developers of processor cores and hardware and software engineers who design SoCs. The advent of open ISAs such as RISC-V has encouraged organizations throughout the world to take a fresh look at open-source processor development. For these organizations, the OpenHW Group aims to drive greater awareness, understanding and availability of open-source processor implementations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connor explains, &ldquo;If you design or are looking for open-source processor IP, OpenHW Group is an organization for collaborating with like-minded engineers. If you&rsquo;re an SoC designer, you don&rsquo;t have to design from scratch; we will help you accelerate your design process by supplying you with a growing range of proven processor IP options, all available within an expanding, high-quality ecosystem. For example, for RISC-V-based processors, we&rsquo;re introducing the CORE-V family of cores, which supports system-on-chip (SoC) hardware and software designers with a quality and manufacturability assurance when adopting RISC-V processor core IP.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Rob Oshana, Chairman of the Board, OpenHW Group and VP Software Engineering, NXP said, &ldquo;The electronics industry is embracing open-source processor technologies at an unprecedented rate. At NXP we believe there&rsquo;s a need to create a deep ecosystem to support adoption of the RISC-V ISA. This includes various components - middleware, stacks and tools - all aligned to move the architecture forward. I&rsquo;m pleased to serve as Chairman of the OpenHW Group board to help realise this goal.&rdquo;</p>
